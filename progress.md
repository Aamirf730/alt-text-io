# Progress

## Current work

- Status: in progress
- Task: document and verify the external archive and private Git backup workflow.

## Completed baseline

- Active source is at commit `1b13f2d` (`Release local Alt Text Pro 1.6.0 updates`).
- Before this documentation work, local source and private `origin/main` pointed to the same commit.
- No tracked file exceeded 20 MiB during the backup audit.
- Local `.env` files and generated dependencies are ignored.

## Decisions

- `Aamirf730/alt-text-io` is the authoritative private source repository.
- Backup-ledger documentation will be committed on a non-production `codex/` branch; production `main` will not be changed as part of archival work.
- The complete containing folder is preserved separately as a full external ZIP.

## Risks and constraints

- Pushing to `main` may trigger production deployment and is outside this archival task.
- Local environment files exist for development and must remain untracked.
- Production services must not be mutated without explicit scoped approval.

## Verification evidence

- 2026-07-18: GitHub repository `Aamirf730/alt-text-io` confirmed private.
- 2026-07-18: `origin/main` and local source both resolved to `1b13f2d` before documentation changes.

## Update history

- 2026-07-18: initialized required project documentation and began verified backup work.
